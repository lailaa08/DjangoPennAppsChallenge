# DjangoPennAppsChallenge

This is my *attempt* at the instagram tech challenge

Instructions for running the code: please download all the files in the repository, then in the command prompt,
copy the path to the instagram folder. Run the server and then, in your browser, put in the link:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

No known bugs

Functionality - I managed to get the user authorization working as well as the login and logout feature, however
I could not get the text addition to work, so I am just submitting the most recent version of the program that
works.

Extra - I spent some time working on the html and css as I have some knowledge in this area, however, the python that
was required for this project was a little too unfamiliar to me.

Feedback - I think that the idea for this tech challenge was great, however, it was a little difficult, even though
I have had previous programming experience. I have never used Django before, so quite a bit of my time was spent
doing the first and second tasks outlined in the document, which is why I did not get very far.
